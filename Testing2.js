00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,640
In 2009, a man named Christopher Coach
bought 5,000 bitcoins on a whim.

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,920
It cost him a grand total of 2700000 dollars.

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,720
He promptly forgot about them and until a few years later
when he saw a news article about Bitcoin, and

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,040
checked out his investment.

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,400
Can you guess what his 5,000
bitcoins were worth?

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:38,600
As of 2018, It was 39,460,525 dollars.

7
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,720
Bitcoin and the rise
of cryptocurrencies

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,120
has been one of the most surprising
milestones of the 21st century.

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,560
And today, we have industry expert Simon Dixon with
us, who will share his perspective on the key

10
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,840
events in the cryptocurrency history.

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:01,120
Simon is an author, Fintech investor, and the CEO
of the online investment platform, BnkToTheFuture.

12
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,760
This whole thing of trying to create a digital currency,
has been going on for quite some time.

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,920
In fact, you know, money is digital by nature, and
the banks were the very first to create a digital

14
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,880
currency, because they took the money that the government
prints and made a digital representation

15
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,160
of it through banking.

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,200
And the money in your online banking
is in fact a digital currency.

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,720
It's not created by the government, it's actually
created by the private bank and it's backed by debt.

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,240
And so, the money, the digital currency, that the banks
have created is a digital representation of

19
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,600
the money that the governments
were originally printing.

20
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:47,480
But, this whole concept of how you actually create
a digital currency that exists without a bank, or

21
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:53,400
without a central bank, was something that was trying
to be popularised shortly after the birth of the internet.

22
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,400
Now, the one that particularly came around that
solved a problem called the "double spend"

23
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,520
problem, was Bitcoin.

24
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,360
Bitcoin solved a problem of
how you actually

25
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,720
have a digital representation of
a currency that can't be counterfeited.

26
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:14,800
In order to do that, they created this very, you
know, specific set of circumstances called

27
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,040
â€œa blockchain", and a specific set of market
incentives that solved that problem.

28
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,280
And, what they did is that they created a way whereby
people running machinery could actually audit

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,280
every transaction, and if those auditors, known
as miners, reach consensus on, you know, one

30
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,720
version of the truth, the ledger, think of it like the
bank, the ledger, showing that this person owns

31
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,200
that amount of money, without them being able to double spend,
was exactly the problem that Bitcoin solved.

32
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,080
And that original white paper was written in 2008,
and in 2009 the first version of Bitcoin was

33
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,440
actually released on the internet.

34
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,480
At that time, the whole concept of Bitcoin was trying
to create a decentralised currency, i.e.

35
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,480
a currency that exists without the need for any central
authority that can control and manipulate

36
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,720
the ecosystem.

37
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,200
And that was really the goal.

38
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:16,840
Now, originally, the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto
which was believed to be a group of people

39
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,600
you know, they created the first version
of that and it was highly centralised.

40
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,400
They were doing the mining.

41
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,840
They were verifying all the transactions.

42
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,200
They were creating the technology.

43
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,960
They were developing, dictating
the development.

44
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:36,040
They were actually encouraging people to build technology
using this protocol, and it was highly

45
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,880
centralised and highly centrally planned.

46
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:50,400
Originally, the very first price for a bitcoin was a
person on a bitcoin talk forum persuaded someone

47
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,800
to buy two pizzas, and they purchased
two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins.

48
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,120
Today, that's, you know, laughed about.

49
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,480
It's a very historical moment in the history of bitcoin
called Bitcoin Pizza Day, because every year

50
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,880
those pizzas become more and more expensive as they've
gone from hundreds of thousands to tens of

51
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,160
millions in value.

52
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,400
But that was originally how it firstly, kind of,
a barter system, that's how it got its value.

53
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:21,320
But then, an exchange came along and allowed people
to, the market, to determine the price in dollars.

54
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,600
And so, people will deposit dollars if they wanted
to buy bitcoin, and then people would naturally

55
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,280
trade with each other as every
FX market does on the book.

56
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,160
What came then, is that people started to realise,
as people could speculate on the price of this

57
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,400
thing, the next use case came along.

58
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,720
The original use case was
censorship resistance.

59
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,200
The second use case was speculation, so people
came along and speculated on the price.

60
00:04:46 --> 00:04:48,400
It was a highly speculative technology.

61
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,960
It was a very strange thing because it
wasn't really a financial asset.

62
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,320
It wasn't really a stock.

63
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,280
It wasn't really a bond.

64
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,920
It wasn't quite a currency.

65
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,600
It wasn't a technology.

66
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,920
It wasn't just a protocol.

67
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,680
It was all of the above because people could use it
how they wanted to use it, and so, people would

68
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,400
speculate on the value of this thing, and it was kind
of like watching the internet born in real time

69
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,800
and having a live price for the technology
called the internet as it gets adoption.

70
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,480
But as people started to speculate on it, then
ordinary businesses that weren't involved in

71
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:26,680
censorship started to try and accept this new
payment method as a marketing scheme.

72
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,680
So, if a shop came along and said, "We accept bitcoin",
the entire bitcoin community would go to that

73
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,840
shop and try and make a transaction.

74
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,880
So after that, you had the very early, you know,
merchants all around the world doing perfectly

75
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,640
legitimate uncensored transactions, trying to use
bitcoin as a marketing strategy, and that would

76
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,480
tend to drive some kind of adoption.

77
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,240
And that would drive more speculation, more merchant
adoption, more use cases as people started to

78
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,320
realise that they could use it for more censorship
resistance, and the bitcoin ecosystem really evolved.
